We are working to make our AssistMe software completely bug free, and
cross-platform, since the bulk of our source code is using languages and
packages supported by all three main OS's. While we've found alternatives for
AutoHotkey for Ubuntu, we have not found an alternative recording software
(Alternative for Pulvoers for Windows), and haven't found a suitable substitute
for either on MacOS. We plan to release a cross-platform AssistMe program later
in 2019.
