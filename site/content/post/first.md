AssistMe is a python application for Windows, that works with the
AutoHotkey scripting language and Pulovers Macro Creator to automate and record
users actions! The user interface uses a simple floating button that
launches a small menu when clicked that gives you options to record a work, misc,
or temporary recording, and to send errors and view the tutorial for help.

Common uses include automating emails,  automating reports (ie. launch
Microsoft Word and add weekly report header), additional clipboards (copying and
pasting multiple/lists of items), automating pulls and pushes to repositories,
automating gaming actions (in-game store purchases, repetitive looting, etc.),
automating commonly used programs to start/stop,etc. Our software can be applied
and useful in a multitude of situations/tasks, and is adaptable to
whatever you need to use it for.
