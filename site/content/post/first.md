AssistMe is a python application for Windows, that works with the
AutoHotkey scripting language and Pulovers Macro Creator to automate and record
users actions! The user interface uses a simple floating button that
launches a small menu when clicked that gives you options to record a work, misc,
or temporary recording, and to send errors and view the tutorial for help.

Microsoft Word and add weekly report header), additional clipboards (copying and
